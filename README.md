## Prepare `_site` for deploy

```sh
git clone -b gh-pages `git config remote.origin.url` _site
```

## Post Ideas

## To Do

- Maybe underline `home` and `tags` on hover

- Only include google analytics if deployed to production
- Set url based on development or production

- Build my own comment system using S3
